v0.6.1  - Fixed a bug that set genre to 'Blues' if no genre was given on the command 
	  line and the MP3 file did not have an existing ID3 tag.

v0.6	- As of this version maintenance of mp3info taken over by Cedric Tefft <cedric@earthling.net>
	- Reworked command-line/curses version to handle processing multiple MP3's.
	- Added -d (delete ID3 tag) switch
	- Added full text/numeric genre handling to command-line, curses and GTK modes.
	- Added -G option (display genre table)
	- View mode is now determined automatically when no other options are specified.  
	  The -v option is accepted for backward compatibility, but ignored.  It 
	  should probably be removed in a future version.
