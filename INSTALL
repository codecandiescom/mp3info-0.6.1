Installing MP3info:

	Just decompress and untar the source (which you should have done by now, if you're reading this...), then type:

	make 
	make install

	or if you only want one of them...

	make mp3info (console) || make gmp3info (X)
	make install

	... and that's it. There should be a binary named mp3info and/or another named gmp3info in your /usr/local/bin

	Check README for usage instructions.
